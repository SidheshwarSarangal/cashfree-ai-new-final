## 💡 Project Overview  

This project combines multiple modern technologies to deliver a seamless AI-powered experience:

- 🌐 **Angular** – Frontend framework  
- 🧠 **Groq APIs** – For AI translation and image analysis  
- ☁️ **Cloudinary** – For image upload and processing  
- 💳 **Cashfree** – To handle subscriptions and payments

As a MERN stack developer, I took this opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and explore Angular. In this project, I integrated **four new technologies**:

1. **Angular** – New frontend framework I learned for this project  
2. **Cloudinary** – For uploading and analyzing images  
3. **Cashfree** – To manage subscription-based payments  
4. **Groq APIs** – To handle translation and image AI tasks  

This project is an example of how quickly a developer can adapt and implement new technologies—something essential in a fast-paced development environment.
