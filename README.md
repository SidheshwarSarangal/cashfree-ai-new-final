## Idea of this project

It is an AI-Powered project which is does AI translations and AI-image analysis, integrated with CASHFREE PAYMENT GATEWAY.

I am a MERN stack developer but I just wanted to learn a new Framework, since in software development you can be asked at any time to learn new technology. So, I learned Angular and integrated cloudinary(for image analysis), cashfree payment gateway(for hadling subscriptions) and groq apis(for handling groq translation and image analysis work). Basically, I integrated 4 new technologies in one project.
